A pointer in C++ is a special variable that stores the memory address of another variable. An asterisk notation is used
to identify the variable as a pointer of a specified type. For example, "float *var" means var is a pointer to a float
variable.  It should be noted that pointer should be initialized with either nullptr or  NULL. Otherwise, the pointer
will affect some unknown location in memory.  When a pointer is assigned to an address of another variable, address
operator (&) is used. When you call the pointer variable, the pointer will return the value of the assigned address of
the variable. Likewise, if a value is assigned to a pointer (with an asterisk in front of the pointer variable), the
value will be passed to the referenced variable. In a function, a pointer can be used in a  function parameter in a
similar fashion as a reference variable. Also,  a function can return a pointer . For example, when a pointer points to
a function that returns a float value, the pointer will be treated as a float variable. In pthread module,  when a
thread is created with pthread_create(), any arguments have to be passed through as a type void pointer.  Therefore, any
 functions that passed to the thread has to return pointer as well.
