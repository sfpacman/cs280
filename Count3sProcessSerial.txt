Program Goal:
This program will read a binary file of 32-bit integers and store the valid integers into an array.
The program then outputs the total occurrence of number 3 found in the binary file.


Organization Design:
Two functions are written to accomplish the goal: store_array and count_three.
The function store_array is designed to take the path of the binary file as input and return an array of valid 4-byte integers.
The function count_three is then taken the array and counts the number 3 in the array which returns the total count of number 3.

Implantation:
The size of the array is declared as a global variable. Since the array is dynamically allocated, the sizeof function is
not a suitable choice to determine the size of the array.
Another option for storing the size of the array is to add the count as the first element of the array.
Since I don't know if the content of the array will be validated or not, I decide to declare the count as a global variable.
The algorithm of counting number three is fairly straightforward.
It goes through the elements sequentially and counts the occurrences of number three.
