Program Goal:
This program will read a binary file of 32-bit integers and store the valid integers into an array.
The program then use pthread library to peforms muti-threading computation and  outputs the total occurrence of number 3 found in the binary file.

Organization Design:
Two functions are written to accomplish the goal: store_array and count_three.
one object , num_collection is written to store the array and its attributes.
The function store_array is designed to take the path of the binary file as input and return an array of valid 4-byte integers in which it will be stored in num_collection.arr.
The length of the array is stored in num_collection.len
4 threads are then created and execute count_three function.
In each threads, count_three access the array from num_collection and counts the number 3 in the array which update the total count of number 3 stored in num_collection.

Implantation:
In this implantation, I use an object to store all the necessary data of the array ( the array, the length and the count of 3), so that the array can be stored
