Program Goal:
This program will read a binary file of 32-bit integers and store the valid integers into an array.
The program then uses pthread library to perform muti-threading computation and outputs the total occurrence of number 3 found in the binary file.

Organization Design:
Two functions are written to accomplish the goal: store_array and count_three.
one class, num_collection is written to store the array and its attributes.
The function store_array is designed to take the path of the binary file as input and return an array of valid 4-byte integers in which it will be stored in num_collection.arr.
The length of the array is stored in num_collection.len
4 threads are then created and execute count_three function.
In each thread, count_three access the array from num_collection and counts the number 3 in the array which updates the total count of number 3 stored in num_collection.

Implantation:
In this implantation, I use a global object, num_array ,to store all the necessary data of the array ( the array, the length and the count of 3), so that each thread can modify the object.
In order to avoid miscalculation, mutexes is used in count_three function to prevent threads writing to the num_array.count_sum at the same time.
Function pthread_join is used in main to wait for all threads to finish to prevent unexpected termination of the process.
